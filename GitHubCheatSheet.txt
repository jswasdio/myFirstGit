This file won't be much help unless you can see it, so you'll already need to have succeeded with the first few steps...


ADD A NEW FILE.
1) Go to https://github.com/
2) Sign in (upper right)
Find "Your repositories"
Click on "myFistGit" (or whatever your repo name is).
3) Add a new file:
   A) Click on the "+" sign after the repository name.
   B) Edit the file.
   C) Commit the file (scroll down to the bottom of the page).
4) Optionally, you can sync ith your local copy if you want.  To do that, see the SYNC section below (if I ever write it).
